# Career Helper App
The career helper app is particularly designed for anyone in the job search. The app would help users track their job search status and skills they need to work on to be better prepared for the job. The main collections in the db would be user basic info, and sub collections would be the jobs that a user has applied to (with attributes like status, job position etc), the skills the candidate has, and skills the candidate would like to work on. This application allows users to keep track of their job application, including storing the job's application url, status, opening date, and position.


## Project Objective
A career helper app built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Deployment URL
